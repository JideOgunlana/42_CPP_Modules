<h2><u>Summary</u></h2>

> *The "ScavTrap" program uses inheritance. A derived class named ScavTrap inherits from ClapTrap class. Every instance of the ScavTrap class has a public member function called guardGate that displays a message on the standard output. The attack function of every ScavTrap instance also displays a different message to that of the ClapTraps' attack function*

<h2><u>Learning Outcomes</u></h2>

- Using the protected keyword to give access to only the base class and derived classes.
- overloading a function.
