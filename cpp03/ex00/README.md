<h2><u>Summary</u></h2>

> *The "ClapTrap" program creates a base class called ClapTrap (a robot) which is to be used in subsequent exercises. A ClapTrap instance has private fields (member attributes) that include: name, hit points, energy points, and attack damage and 3 member functions: attack, takeDamage and beRepaired. <br>When a ClapTrap instance repairs itself it get N amount of hit points back, this costs 1 energy point as well as for an attack. If an instance is out of either energy points or hit points, it cannot do anything (i.e repair or attack)*
