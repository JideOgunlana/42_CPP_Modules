<h2><u>Summary</u></h2>

> *The "FixedPointOperatorOverload" program overloads operators that work on a fixed point number, operators such as +, -, x, /, >, <, ==, ++. -- and also computes the minimum and maximum of two fixed point numbers using static member functions min/max*

<h2><u>Learning Outcomes</u></h2>

- Overloading operators in C++
