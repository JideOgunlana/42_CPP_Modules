<h2><u>Summary</u></h2>

> *The "FixedPointConversion" program converts C++ number data types (float / int) to fixed point number and vice-versa*

<h2><u>Learning Outcomes</u></h2>

- Use of adhoc polymorphism (function overloading) to specialize functions having the same name
- Using fixed point numbers in an environment that requires adequate performance, over range or precision, such as signal processing applications, embedded systems, graphics applications
