[![C++](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=cpp)](https://skillicons.dev) ~ *(3rd module)*   



<br/>

## To Learn

- Orthodox Canonical Form of classes
- Adhoc polymorphism
- Operator overloading
- Fixed point numbers

<br/>

## Tasks include

1. Writing a class in the orthodox canonical form
2. Converting C++ number data types to fixed point numbers and vice-versa
3. Overloading operators such as assignment, arithmetic, comparison, increment, and decrement operators
4. Implementing static member functions to compute the minimum and maximum values of two fixed-point numbers


<br/>

## USAGE

Here are instructions for compiling exercises in this project:

1. without parameters, compile all exercises with the <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">"*build.sh*"</span> script
```console
./build.sh
```
2. With parameter <span style="color:DeepSkyblue">clean</span> - delete all object files
```console
./build.sh clean
```
3. With parameter <span style="color:DeepSkyblue">fclean</span> - delete all object files and executables
```console
./build.sh fclean
```

<span style="color:orange">__Alternatively__ </span>you can compile specific exercises by navigating to their respective directories and using their makefiles
```console
cd ex00 && make
