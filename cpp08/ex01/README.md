## Summary

> The *`Span`* program uses a \"Span\" class that stores a maximum of N integers and provides functions to find the shortest and longest spans between the stored numbers. Adding numbers using the addNumber() function is limited to the capacity of N, and attempting to add more will throw an exception.

You can modify the main to test.
