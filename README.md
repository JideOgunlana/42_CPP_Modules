# CPP Modules

## Summary
> `CPP Modules`is a modular approach to learning `C++`. Each module builds upon the previous one, introducing new concepts and allowing learners to progressively expand their understanding.

>Each module focuses on essential topics such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, interfaces, exceptions, and templates. By exploring these concepts, I gained a solid foundation in C++ and understand how it extends the capabilities of the C programming language, transforming it into an object-oriented language.
