<h2><u>Summary</u></h2>

> *The "ex03" program adds an Intern class. The intern has no name, grade and no unique characteristics. All that the intern does is to create a form.*


```cpp
{
    Intern someRandomIntern;
    Form* scf;
    scf = someRandomIntern.makeForm("shrubbery creation", "Amy");
}
```
