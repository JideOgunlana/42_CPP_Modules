<h2><u>Summary</u></h2>

> *The "Polymorphism" program shows the behaviour of Cat and Dog classes derived from an Animal class. The two derived classes have a specialised function of makeSound, that allows both animals to make sounds specific to them, as their type is known, while an Animal class doesn't make a specific sound as it is having no specific type, nevertheless, it still makes one.*
