<h2><u>Summary</u></h2>

> *The "DebuggingAssistant" program creates a class called "Harl" that automates the output of different types of messages, including DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, and ERROR. The messages are classified by levels and contain different information depending on the level. The Harl class has four private member functions that output messages corresponding to each level of the message. This program aims to automate the process of generating these types of messages, making it easier for developers to diagnose potential issues in their systems..*

<h2><u>Learning Outcomes</u></h2>
