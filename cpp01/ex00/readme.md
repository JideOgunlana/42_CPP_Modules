<h2><u>Summary</u></h2>

> *The "StackVsHeap" program creates a zombie instance either on the stack or heap. The zombie created on a stack is given a name and announces itself automatically with the message "BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ...," while that created on a heap is also given a name but doesn't automatically announce itself*

<h2><u>Learning Outcomes</u></h2>

- creating an instance of a class dynamically with "*new*" to allow its usage outside of a function scope.
-  destroying a dynamically allocated instance of a class with "*delete*"
