## Summary
### Reverse Polish Notation
> The *`RPN`* program uses an inverted Polish mathematical expression to perform simple arithmetic.


#### The program must adhere to these rules:
- Processes an expression where numbers passed are less that 10.
- Operands and operators passed must be in RPN format.
- Handle `* / + -` operators.
- Handle errors during execution and displaying an error message to the standard output.
- Braces don't need to be hanlded


#### Sample


```
./RPN "2 3 4 + -"

Output:

-5
```
